Notes about the analysis

2023-02-12
- Run jobs in cops node
- save results from jobs in /cfs/data/pg/sdaqs/esrf-ebs/id10/sc5275/20220614/processed/results/
- save results as h5 files in /cfs/home/mabi3848/id10-ferritin-2022/proc-results
  Need to change this: Anita and Sonja will work on it so we need a directory accessible from everyone

2023-03-28
- save analysis h5 files in /cfs/data/pg/sdaqs/esrf-ebs/id10/sc5275/20220614/processed/h5-files/

2023-03-31
- before running python scripts: 
      source .venv/bin/activate

2023-04-12
- convert2hdf5.py gives an error: debug and ask Sonja 

2023-04-14
- made a new mask with Anita (cryo-mask-230412.npy) which aggressively masks a lot of pixels

2023-04-17
- testing new mask cryo-mask-230412.npy using python analysis-script.py ferritin_conc120_gly_50_2 2 --proc (jobs 324047_[0-3])
- mask che funziona probabilmente: cryo-mask-230417_roersa.npy
- and setup file setup-roersa-cryo-230417.pkl with qv_init = [(np.arange(.028, .48, .04), .04)] (qvals=[0.028 0.068 0.108 0.148 0.188 0.228 0.268 0.308 0.348 0.388 0.428 0.468], len(qvals)=12)
- UPDATE: the latest mask is "cryo-mask-230417_03.npy" and the setupfile "setup-fullmask-cryo-230417.pkl" with same qvals as above. Both in directory /cfs/home/mabi3848/id10-ferritin-2022/test/setups

- created the new folder structure for running the analysis: 01-notebooks, 02-scripts, 03-source, 04-jobs. While in the data folder we have processed with results, h5-files, mask-setup

start first real analysis with:

2023-04-21
TO DO IN THE NEXT DAYS
  - ttcs loading way too slow
  - filter before the convert2hdf5.py and then save the averaged filtered ttcs in a h5 file
  - add elog entries in h5 file

2023-05-22
- implementing filtering of ttcs in test_convert2hdf5.py
- implementing elog metadata in test_convert2hdf5_elog.py

2023-06-13
- successfully implemented elog metadata in test_convert2hdf5.py
- now working on fixing the filtering of ttcs
- i think i'm saving wrongly avaraged ttcs

2023-06-14
- found error in the definition of the number of repetition. Fixed the function in 02-scripts/function/metadata.py
- successfully implemented ttc and g2 averaging in test_convert2hdf5.py: get one ttc per repetition for each q, the same for the g2
- run: sbatch job_convert.sbatch ferritin_conc_gly_50_6 5 4 (job 336950)

2023-06-15
- checked if the analysis from job 336950 makes sense. It does.
- running fluences ferritin_conc_gly_50_5 4-6 jobs(337132, 337136, 337137)
- for later (done):
    - running entries 134-138 of the elog (ferritin_conc_gly_50_6 datasetnumber 2-6, T=250-210)

2023-06-19
- plotting g2s at 220K different fluxes (ferritin_conc_gly_50_5_0004-6) and the last two perfectly overlap, so I think I'm overwriting something in the analysis scripts
- check if the problem in the yml file. I think so. Analysis resubmitted for the different fluences

2023-06-20
- check job 338233_ failed (ferritin_conc_gly_50_6_0003). I think there is a problem in one of the scans, perhaps the h5 file is deprecated.
- 2023-06-20T14-26-49-732.job-338343_0.err check it. Same run. 
- coverting temps analysis: 
- ferritin_conc_gly_50_6_0003: scan 53 deprecated 

2023-06-28
- Background subtraction of the scattering intensity => ISSUES
    - the Iq of ferritin has a weird shape around the protein peak qâ‰ˆ0.23 nm-1
    - the 2d image shows a lot of scattering in module 2 (cone shape), and a sort of jump in intensity between module 2 and 3.
    - the background 2d image doesn't show anything similar, looks smooth, although there is a lot of scattering a low q.
    - if the weird scattering is static, the g2s should be fine
    - if the weird scattering is there in all the measurements, it should be present also in the bkg, but it's not. And the strong scattering of ferritin should hide it instead of highlighting it.
    - now running apoferritin to see if the strange scattering is also there

2023-06-30
- worked on the q-dependence of the contrast. Tried with both Anita's and Fivos' scripts, which give very different results, especially at large q.
  May be because Anita's estimations are for XFELs (check Felix' paper).
- to match the actual contrast that we have, I need to change the beam size to 24um instead of 30um

2023-07-03
- running analysis for ferritin_conc100_gly_50_1 datafolders 2, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13 (T=250, 240, 240, 230, 260, 270 K with 100% transm)
- run ferritin_conc100_gly_50_1_0010, scan0057 (the last one) is deprecated

2023-07-04
- running ferritin_conc_gly_50_5_0003 T=240 45%
- running ferritin_conc120_gly_50_2 2-5 T=240 K fluxes 100,45,22.5,11.5%

2023-07-05
- c2 fluxes 270K 100,45% (ferritin_conc100_gly_50_1 13-14) way too fast to see anything

2023-07-06
- c3 fluxes 240K 100,45,22.5,11% (ferritin_conc120_gly_50_2 2-5) shows slow down upon increasing the flux. Same behavior as for c1
- Lowest transmission  ferritin_conc120_gly_50_2_0005 11.5% has a super weird Iq, discard this run


2023-07-10
- wrote a script to analyse single frames for calculating saxs curve. Running it for ferritin_conc120_gly_50_2_0002
- checked ttcs for beginning and end (frame_in = 10, 3500). No slow down, no sign of aggregation, they overlap

2023-07-11
- flux dependence of the g2s is wrong! I was using the wrong delay time because each run has a different exposure time!

2023-09-12
- chi4 analysis done before the summer break didn't give any signal

2023-09-20
- normalized diffusion coefficient to assess the lineshapes
    - different concentrations seem to have roughly the same, but we have only highest temperatures
    - big uncertainty on viscosity at low temps and on concentrations
    - deviation from SE more pronounced at low temps
- chi4 analysis: too noisy, impossible to see any signal

2023-09-28
- worked on DLS data to get diffusion coefficients and viscosity

2023-10-02
- got a rough, but more precise than before, concentration of c0-3 from UV-Vis. 
- from those, calculated actual glycerol/water fraction and imported viscosity values from the webpage http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~sws04cdw/viscosity_calc.html
  The values of viscosity are not reliable below 270 K. Need to find good references.
- plotted the diffusion coefficients using those viscosity values and Rh=5.8 nm


2023-10-04
- saxs frames analysis jobid 355256 (2023-10-04T10-45-14-168.job)
- checked wether first or last 200 frames are maybe affected by the shutter, but this doesn't seem to be the case. Though, the Iq looks smoother if I average only 200 frames. Don't know why yet
- analysi with anita's setupwhatch out no xpcs, check job id to select the correct processed database. jobs crashed, check why

2023-10-09
- found an interesting trend of the first parly visible peak in the chi4 for different concentrations
- rebinned I(q) with the same qs as the D(q). The goal is to get the H(q) = S(Q)/D(q)

2023-10-10
- calculated the chi4 for all the temperatures and all the concentrations. Trend visible in c1, not so clear in c2 and c3
- c3 is very noisy

2023-10-11/12
- calculating the chi4 for c1 at different qs to see if there is a q dependence or any kind of trend

2023-10-16
- calculating the chi4 at different qs for c2 and c3. C2 seems to have some kind of trend at 240K, but have to look into it more carefully

2023-10-24
- Arrhenius "fit" gives activation energies between 3.6 (diluted) and 5-7 kJ/mol

2023-11-06
- Administrative programming: cleaned up scripts for job submission and data processing

2023-11-17
- plots for paper and arrhenius fits of diffusion coefficient vs temperatures
 
2023-11-21
- plots for paper: chi4 and ttc

2023-12-04
- working on normalization of chi4

2024-01-19
- worked on the modelling of chi4. Generate a signal with gaussian distribution which follows exponential decay model. Then calculated the g2, ttc, chi4 from 100 trajectories.
- no results

2024-03-09
- added diffusion coefficients of dls data

2024-03-27
- working on DLS diffusion coefficients to add them to fig.3?

2024-04-22
- fitting MSD to get Diffusion coefficient
- Diffusion coefficient at q=0.11 1/nm for different temperatures overlap with that obtained from the fits of g2
- don't know what I should get from this

2024-04-25
- was working on diffusion coefficients from DLS measurements.

2024-05-13
- estimated concentration of c1, c2, c3 from calibration curves by Anita. Results give 103. 136 and 314 mg/ml respecively
- the Iq was first rebinned. Then a baseline was subtracted, normalized by peak amplitude. Then gaussian fit of the peak to extract the peak position, which then provides the protein concentration.
Summary of what found today:

c (mg/ml) 	 v% 	 w% 	 mol% 	 label
102 		 48.9 	 54.8 	 19.2     c1
135 		 50.6 	 56.4 	 20.2     c2
314 		 60.5 	 65.9 	 27.5     c3
