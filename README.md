# ID10 sc5275 beamtime analysis

Analysis tools for the experiment sc5275 at [ESRF-EBS](http://www.esrf.eu) (beamline ID10). The experiment uses XPCS in SAXS geometry on ferritin solutions. This repo includes:
* python scripts for analysing the data by submitting slurm jobs
* python scripts for reducing the analysis and collecting the results for each run in a `.h5` file
* Jupyter notebooks for analysis interpretation

The job submission is design for Fysikum HPC at Stockholm University.

# update in the future
* run jupyter in a given node with memory allocated
* submit analysis jobs
* useful git command
